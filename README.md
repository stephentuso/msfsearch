MSFSearch is an open source search application for the msf staff. The problem that they were facing was writing names of places was impossible to do accurately. The staff would write it phonetically, however is was not always accurate. One example is 'gym' vs. 'jim'. While phonectly the same they are written differently. A normal search tool would not be able to return results for jim and gym if the user searched for gym. The MSFSearch app allows users to search and find phonetically similar results in the MSF database.
